# Restaurant_Rating_Prediction

The Objective of this project is to predict the ratings of the restaurants.

# A little explanation of dataset :
```
1.The dataset which im using here is zomato dataset of Bangalore city
2.Bangalore city is the IT capital of india, So most of the people in bangalore will dont have time to
cook the food for themselves.
3.So their is high demand for the restaurants.
4.Restaurants which are newly established and connect with zomato cannot compete with the restaurants which are already established and have good market value.
5.Considering the above problem i need to find some features which has effect on the ratings.
6.So that i can create a UI which gives the newly restaurants as well as old restaurants a chance to 
serve their customers based on their ratings.
